Description: This package provides information and statistics for various regions or countries. Use the function RegionFinder to find the region a requested country is located in. The reverse is also possible in CountryFinder by supplying a Region, which gives you the countries present in that region. Population_finder needs a country and year as input. Population_finder then provides the total population for that country during that year. Life_expectancy_graph asks for a region and year as input. Afterwards Life_expectancy_graph generates a bar graph showing the average life_expectancy for each country in said region for that year. Use the functions in this package to your liking for easy access to statistics around the globe!
